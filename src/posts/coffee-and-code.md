# Coffee and Code

The coffee shop was nearly empty at 6 AM. I sat by the window, laptop open, watching the city wake up. Steam rose from my cup as my fingers hovered over the keyboard. The problem I'd been wrestling with for days suddenly seemed clearer in the morning light. Sometimes the best debugging happens not at your desk, but in these quiet in-between moments.

I wrote the first line of code, then another. The solution unfolded naturally, like it had been there all along, waiting for me to stop overthinking and just start typing. By the time the morning rush filled the café with noise and chatter, I had it working. I closed my laptop, took the last sip of my now-cold coffee, and smiled. Tomorrow I'd be back at my desk, facing new challenges. But today, I'd remember that sometimes all you need is a change of scenery and a quiet morning to see things clearly.
