# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and technical insights here.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a space to document my journey as a software engineer, share what I'm learning, and connect with others in the tech community.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering experiences
- Technical deep-dives
- Career growth and reflections
- Side projects and experiments

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **React** - For the UI
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool
- **Markdown** - Simple content management
- **Dark Mode** - Easy on the eyes

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
