# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Personal portfolio website built with Create React App and deployed to GitHub Pages. The site showcases experience, projects, and personal tidbits.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time or after pulling)
npm install

# Start development server (opens on http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (builds and pushes to gh-pages branch)
npm run deploy
```

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **React 17** with class and functional components
- **React Router v5** using HashRouter (required for GitHub Pages)
- **Bootstrap 4** for styling with react-bootstrap components
- **Create React App** tooling (webpack, babel, eslint)

### Routing Structure
Uses HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility. Routes are accessed via hash fragments (e.g., `/#/experience`).

**Main Routes:**
- `/` - Home page
- `/experience` - Work experience
- `/projects` - Project portfolio
- `/tidbits` - Personal tidbits/blog

### Component Architecture
- **App.js**: Main component that sets up Router and renders NavBar + route-based page components
- **NavBar.jsx**: Persistent navigation bar with responsive collapse functionality
- **Page Components** (in `src/components/`): Home, Experience, Projects, Tidbits - each represents a full page view

### Git Branch Structure
- **master**: Source code (work here for development)
- **gh-pages**: Deployed build files (auto-generated by `npm run deploy`, do not edit directly)

Always work on the master branch. The deploy script handles building and pushing to gh-pages.

## Key Implementation Details

### Why HashRouter?
GitHub Pages serves static files and doesn't support server-side routing. HashRouter uses URL fragments (`#/path`) which work with static hosting since everything after `#` is client-side only.

### Deployment Process
The `npm run deploy` command:
1. Runs `npm run build` (via predeploy script)
2. Pushes the `build/` directory contents to the gh-pages branch
3. GitHub Pages serves from the gh-pages branch

### Bootstrap Integration
Bootstrap CSS is imported globally in App.js. Components use Bootstrap classes directly rather than styled-components or CSS modules.
